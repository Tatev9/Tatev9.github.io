   <p> <i class ="taxonomy class ">Sea</i> snakes, or <i class = "taxonomy class">coral</i> reef snakes, are a subfamily of <strong>venomous,</strong> <i class="taxonomy order ">elapid</i> snakes, <b>the Hydrophiinae</b>, that inhabit marine environments for most or all of their lives. Most are extensively adapted to a fully aquatic life and are unable to move on land, except for the genus <i class ="taxonomy class"> Laticauda</i>, which has limited land movement. They are found in warm coastal waters from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and are closely related to venomous terrestrial snakes in Australia.[2]
   All sea snakes have ,<i>paddle-like</i> tails and many have laterally compressed bodies that give them an <i>eel-like </i>appearance. Unlike fish, they do not have gills and must surface regularly to breathe. Along with whales, they are among the most completely aquatic of all air-breathing vertebrates.[3]<strong> Among this group are species with some of the most potent venoms of all snakes. Some have gentle dispositions and bite only when provoked, but others are much more aggressive. Currently, 17 genera are described as sea snakes, comprising 69 species.</strong></p>
